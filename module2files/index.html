    <h4>Chicken</h4>
    <p>This beautiful, delectable honey-glazed chicken sprinkled with crunchy sesame seeds and a smattering of fresh spring onions complements the rice and noodles
        that have been tenderly infused with tea and smoke, for your pleasure and amusement. Watch out for the chilli seeds, as they can be spicy.

        this dish is pull-apart melt-in-the-mouth deliciousness. Also available in lemon-herb, garlic-butter and tom-yum styles.

        <h4>Sushi</h4>
        <p>Experience the fresh flavours of Japanese cuisine, as you bite into the sushi platter that encompasses various popular seafood styles.
